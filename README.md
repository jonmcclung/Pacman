# Pacman

This is one of the games I made before I started attending Tennessee Tech. I would have made it during the summer of 2015. I know the code design is horrible, everything I knew about programming I had taught myself in the previous 6 months.

That being said, this project does display the use of a simple AI with A*, custom UI, and an event loop, among other things. The artwork is all custom-made by me, and the maze layout is randomly generated each time.
